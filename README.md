SPOJ
====

Solutions to programming problems I've attempted in SPOJ. This repository was originally started because I wanted to get familiar with version control tools and techniques. Now that I'm fairly well versed with it, this repository is hardly active. In fact, I even did a [workshop introducing version control to my  juniors](http://www.slideshare.net/sarupbanskota/using-open-source-software-to-uncover-extra-terrestrials).

Please feel free to use anything in this repository^.
