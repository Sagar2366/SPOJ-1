SPOJ
====

Solutions to programming problems at SPOJ that I've attempted. I've posted them here so I get familiar with git, and get started with Open Source. I love programming in Python, although I will attempt to include solutions in C++ as well.

You're free to use them as reference for problems that you may want to solve. I would appreciate better approaches to solving any of the problems I've attempted.
